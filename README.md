This code is 100% open-source.
You can do whatever you want with this code.
The binaries output everything by outputing nothing.
I can run this program more than 500 times in parallel on my main PC.
I made this binary run both on an OS.
I also made this binary run as a Boot Loader and an OS by turning my BIOS in CSM or Legacy, it doesn't work with UEFI.
Here is the code:

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    while(true)
    {
    bool truth = 1;
    bool Infinity = truth + 1;
    if(0)
    {
        1;
    }
    cin >> Infinity;
    cout << Infinity;
    }
    return true;
}
